## Frequently Asked Questions
**Why realize a new roleplay project ?**

It is not only a new roleplay project but a brand new gamemode realized in a new technology still rare on SAMP. This new gamemode brings a breath of freshness on SAMP and at the same time a new kind of roleplay until almost never played. The project tends towards a flexible and therefore simple roleplay, here, owning a vehicle or a house is done quickly, entering a faction is fast and one does not need to spend 1 month of his life just to be able to play. We try to focus only on the roleplay scenes that are fun and not the boring ones.
